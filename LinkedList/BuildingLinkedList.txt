insert with recursion
step's for this algo
1. travel till the index
how are we going to travel till that index with recursion
2. make a newNode


let's visualize this 
1    2   4   5   6   1   6

let's suppose that we have to add the node at index 2 i.e. at position where 4 is
1   2   4   5
we travel onto the 5

and then we make the newNode at 5 
1   2   4   5
           / 
        newNode 9

something like this 

i think the recursion call is going to be somewhat like this
1.next(reursion(2));
1 is the head and 2 is the head.next correct

now after doing that we are returning the newNode.
so pichla head.necxt which is 4 will have the next as it's newNode

now my solution worked


1   2   4   5
         \ / 
        newNode 9


now let's work with the deletion of node

1   2   4   5   7

let's suppose we have to deleet the node with the value 4 (but with the recursion) 
 
1   2   |4|   5   7

so the idea is to connect the 2 with 5
so the link of 4 will be garbage collected

1. thing is to travel till 4
2. thing is to check that 4's next is not null 
3. thing is just break the link and make a new link

yup that's how this you this !

but the chatgpt's solution is good
you just travel onto the required node with the same value
and then just return the next node to that node so it get's skipped
